	<h2>MatBots</h2>
</p>

<p>
MatBots are primitive AIs, 'assistants' if you will, that use minimalistic GUI dialogs to guide the user through a data processing pipeline in Matlab.
</p>

<p>
Isn't that an 'app'? Bots are much more restrictive than apps. Users are, to a greater extent than in an app, guided through the correct steps to perform a task. A bot usually performs a much more limited task than an app.
</p>

<p>
When possible, bots have a 'headless' mode, which allows them to execute a processing pipeline as a typical Matlab function, either on an image or a folder of images.
