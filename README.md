# MatBots

MatBots are primitive AIs, 'assistants' if you will,
that use minimalistic GUI dialogs to guide the user through a
data processing pipeline in Matlab.
 
Isn't that an 'app'?
Bots are much more restrictive than apps.
Users are, to a greater extent than in an app,
guided through the correct steps to perform a task.
A bot usually performs a much more limited task than an app.

When possible, bots have a 'headless' mode,
which allows them to execute a processing pipeline as a typical
Matlab function, either on an image or a folder of images.

Each directory (except 'docs') contains a bot for the task
suggested by the directory's name. For more details, see ReadMe.txt inside.
