A bot to pack a folder of images into stacks (a stack is an image with multiple planes),
using tokens.

For example, if a folder contains the images...

Im1Chan1.tif
Im1Chan2.Tif
Im1Chan3.Tif
Im2Chan1.tif
Im2Chan2.Tif
Im2Chan3.Tif

...the bot can help making two stacks with 3 channels each by using the tokens 'Chan1',
'Chan2' and 'Chan3'.

To run, call stackPackBot from Matlab's prompt, and follow the instructions.
